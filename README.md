# PaintCalculator
Calculator to take the dimensions of a room and output the Area of the floor, amount of paint required to paint the walls and volume of the room.

Assumptions -
The software assumes that 10m squared requires 1L of paint.
This also assumes that the room that needs to be painted will be square/rectangle with no spaces on the walls that dont need to be painted.

Improvements given more time - 
Given more time i would give the user the ability to subtract areas from the room that might be taken up by windows or doors.
I would also add a feature that allows the user to choose irregular shaped rooms and choose the different measurements for it.

How to run the program -
Open up the PaintCalculator.sln file with visual studio and press the run program button.
To build the program use the build program feature on the top of the visual studio software.
